# Python for DS ML Bootcamp
Exercises from taking Udemy online course - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp. The notes cover what I learnt from the online courses.

Including:
- numpy 
- pandas and pandas.plot
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly and cufflinks
- two data analytics projects (911 data, 6 banks stock price data)
- machine learning algorithms:
  * Supervised
    1. linear regression (from linear_model family)
    2. logistic regression (from linear_model family)
    3. k-nearest-neighbor (knn) (from knn family)
    4. decision trees (from tree family)
    5. random forests & grid search (from emsemble and model selection family)
  * Unsupervised
- deep learning algorithms:
  1. natural language processing
  2. neural net and deep learning
